            <h2>What is Scene Classification?</h2>
            <p>Scene classification is the task of automatically categorizing the type or category of a given image based on its content. It is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in various domains such as image retrieval, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance systems.</p>
            <h2>How Does Scene Classification Work?</h2>
            <p>Scene classification algorithms typically involve extracting informative features from the input image and using machine learning techniques to learn patterns and relationships between these features and scene categories. Commonly used features include color histograms, texture descriptors, and deep features extracted from convolutional neural networks (CNNs).</p>
            <h2>Applications of Scene Classification</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Image retrieval: Finding similar images in large databases.</li>
                <li>Robotics: Helping robots understand and navigate their environment.</li>
                <li>Autonomous vehicles: Assisting in road understanding and navigation.</li>
                <li>Surveillance systems: Identifying and monitoring activities in security footage.</li>
